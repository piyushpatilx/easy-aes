# easy-aes
AES Encryption utility that uses  OpenSSL to Encrypt Files

What is AES ?

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is widely used today as it is a much stronger than DES and triple DES despite being harder to implement.
This utility uses 256 bit Encryption.

Features
1. Encryption
2. Decryption
3. Shredding

What is Shredding ?

When it comes to computers and data, recycling leaves traces of information on storage drives that can be retrieved using special software. However, this scenario can be avoided by "shredding" data rather than simply emptying your recycle bin.

The Utility is written in Python3 and requires OpenSSL installed.
